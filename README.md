# FixMyHome - Homeowner-Handyman Marketplace

A two-sided marketplace platform connecting Florida homeowners with local handymen for home repair jobs.

## Overview

FixMyHome allows:
- **Homeowners** to post jobs with budgets and receive competitive bids
- **Handymen** to browse local jobs and submit quotes to win work
- Both parties to message, complete jobs, and leave reviews

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router, React Server Components)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Database:** MySQL (Hostinger-managed) with Prisma ORM (`@prisma/adapter-mariadb`)
- **Authentication:** Auth.js (self-hosted, email/password via Credentials provider)
- **File Storage:** Uploadthing
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **State Management:** TanStack Query + Zustand
- **Deployment:** Hostinger hPanel Node.js hosting (Git auto-deploy). `Dockerfile`/`docker-compose.yml` are kept for local Docker-based dev but are not used in production.

## Project Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Next.js project initialization with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Database schema design (Users, Jobs, Bids, Messages, Reviews)
- Core dependencies installed
- Prisma configuration
- Utility files and constants

🚧 **In Progress:**
- Database setup (requires Hostinger MySQL connection)
- shadcn/ui component setup

📋 **Upcoming (Week 1):**
- Authentication flow (sign-in, sign-up, role selection)
- Onboarding forms (homeowner & handyman)
- Layout components (header, navigation, footer)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set Up Database (Hostinger-managed MySQL)

The app runs against MySQL via `@prisma/adapter-mariadb` (compatible with both MySQL and MariaDB servers).

1. In hPanel, go to Databases → MySQL Databases and create a database + user.
2. Create `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Copy .env.example to .env
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` using the host/user/password/db name from hPanel, e.g. `mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/dbname`.

### 2. Apply the Database Schema

There's no `prisma/migrations` history in this repo (the Hostinger MySQL user doesn't have the shadow-database privileges `prisma migrate dev`/`deploy` require), so the schema is applied directly:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

This creates all tables (User, Job, Bid, Message, Review, etc.) with proper indexes.

### 3. Set Up Authentication

Auth is self-hosted via [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev) (Credentials provider — email/password against the `User` table) — no external dashboard or account needed.

1. Generate a secret and add it to `.env`:

```bash
npx auth secret
```

2. On any deployment that isn't Vercel (i.e. Hostinger), also set:

```
AUTH_TRUST_HOST="true"
AUTH_URL="https://fixmyhome.pro"
```

Sign-in/sign-up/redirect routes are fixed in code (`/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/role-selection`) — no dashboard configuration required.

### 4. Set Up Uploadthing (for photo uploads)

1. Create account at [Uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com)
2. Create a new app
3. Copy your secret and app ID to `.env`:

```
UPLOADTHING_SECRET="sk_live_..."
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID="..."
```

### 5. Install shadcn/ui Components

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

When prompted:
- **Style:** Default
- **Base color:** Slate
- **CSS variables:** Yes

Then install base components:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button input textarea select card badge dialog dropdown-menu form label avatar separator skeleton toast
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Database Schema

### Core Models

- **User** - Authentication & role management (HOMEOWNER | HANDYMAN)
- **HandymanProfile** - Extended profile for handymen (skills, radius, ratings)
- **Job** - Posted jobs with budget, location, category
- **JobPhoto** - Photos attached to jobs (up to 5)
- **Bid** - Handyman quotes on jobs
- **Message** - Thread-based messaging per bid
- **Review** - 1-5 star ratings after job completion

### Relationships

- One User can post many Jobs (homeowner)
- One User can submit many Bids (handyman)
- One Job has many Bids
- One Bid has many Messages
- One Job has one Review

## Deployment

### Deploy via Hostinger hPanel (Node.js auto-deploy)

Production deploys through hPanel's Git-connected Node.js hosting — it pulls the repo, runs `npm install` (which triggers `prisma generate` via `postinstall`) and `npm run build`, then starts the app itself. No Docker is involved in production.

Domain: **fixmyhome.pro**

1. In hPanel → Websites → Node.js, connect this repo (`https://github.com/seuth325/MyHomeProjects.git`) and set:
   - **Node version:** 22.x
   - **Application startup file:** `.next/standalone/server.js` (required because `next.config.ts` sets `output: "standalone"`)
   - **Environment variables:** `DATABASE_URL` (Hostinger MySQL connection string), `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true`, `AUTH_URL=https://fixmyhome.pro`, Uploadthing keys, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://fixmyhome.pro`, `NODE_ENV=production` — see `.env.example` for the full list.
2. Apply the schema once, via hPanel's terminal or SSH, from the app's build directory:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

3. Trigger Deploy/Redeploy from hPanel. TLS is handled by Hostinger's own certificate management for the domain.

Re-deploy after pushing new code by hitting hPanel's Deploy button (or pushing to the connected branch, if auto-deploy-on-push is enabled), then re-run `npx prisma db push` if the schema changed.

If the build ever fails with a stale/corrupted checkout (e.g. permission errors under `.builds/source`), delete `~/domains/fixmyhome.pro/public_html/.builds` via SSH and redeploy to force a clean clone.

### Alternative: Docker (local dev only)

The repo also ships a multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` (app + MySQL) for local development or a self-managed VPS instead of hPanel:

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # set MYSQL_PASSWORD and DATABASE_URL=mysql://fixmyhome:<pw>@db:3306/fixmyhome
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose run --rm migrate
```

This is not the path used for the fixmyhome.pro production deploy.

### Database Schema Changes

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

Inside Docker, use `docker compose run --rm migrate` instead.
